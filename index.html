                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>This is a website that displays and gives information on 4 of my favourite/helpful/practical websites.

                    Each website has a dedicated page where you can click and read about what the different websites do and why they're one of my favourites.
                    
                    Every page has a screenshot image of the website that's being showcased to show what the website looks like. The images have been improved so that the loading time of each page doesn't take long.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>This is a product website that I've made with 5 different products. I used WordPress to make the products and fetched it with JavaScript making a call to the WordPress API.

                    It displays all 5 products on the home page and the "View Details" button takes you to a spesific page with the respective product and provides more details about it.</p>
